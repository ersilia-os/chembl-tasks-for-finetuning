# ChEMBL tasks for fine-tuning

Extract tasks from ChEMBL for model fine-tuning

## Background

This repository contains code to extract **classification** and **regression** tasks from ChEMBL. The ultimate goal is to use these tasks to fine-tune the [TabPFN model](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08328-6).
